A Python implementation to the Flexible Audio Source Separation Toolbox

Abstract
========
This toolbox is meant to allow to use the framework FASST and extend it within a python program. It is primarily a re-write in Python of the original Matlab (C) version. The object programming framework allows to extend and create 

Using the Python package
========================

Dependencies
------------

Most of the code is written in `Python <http://www.python.org>`_, but occasionally, there may be some C source code, requiring either Cython or SWIG for compiling. In general, to run this code, the required components are:

  * Matplotlib http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net 
  * Numpy http://numpy.scipy.org
  * Scipy http://www.scipy.org
  * setuptool https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

Install
-------

In addition to the aforementioned packages, installing this package requires to compile the tracking part, in :py:mod:`pyfasst.SeparateLeadStereo.tracking`. In the corresponding folder, type::

  python setup.py build_ext --inplace



Examples
--------

  * Using the provided audio model classes

  * Creating a new audio model class

Algorithms
==========

The FASST framework is described in [Ozerov2012]_. We have implemented this Python version mostly thanks to the provided Matlab (C) code available at http://bass-db.gforge.inria.fr/fasst/. 

For initialization purposes, several side algorithms and systems have also been implemented:
  * SIMM model (Smooth Instantaneous Mixture Model) from [Durrieu2010]_ and [Durrieu2011]_: allows to analyze, detect and separate the lead instrument from a polyphonic audio (musical) mixture. Note: the original purpose of this implementation was to provide a sensible way of using information from the SIMM model into the more general multi-channel audio source separation model provided, for instance, by FASST. 
  
  * DEMIX algorithm (Direction Estimation of Mixing matrIX) [Arberet2010]_ for spatial mixing parameter initialization.
